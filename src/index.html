    <h4>Full stack development. Buzz words to some but and ideaology to others. Regardless of others opinion on the matter
     <p>I have worked to upkeep proficiency in all aspects of application development. Even if you don't use every facet of your
      knoledgebase on a daily basis, knowing how to solve problems in a variety of enviroments hastens your reaction to problems
      and enables you to develop creative solutions. Many programmers develop skills suitable for a single technology level, be it
      client side, server side, database level or somewhere in between. Being proficient in each of those levels gives me the ability
      to have a better understanding of the connections between them and to gain a broader view of how an application can be made and function. </p>
